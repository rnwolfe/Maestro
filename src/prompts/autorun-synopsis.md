Provide a brief synopsis of what you just accomplished in this task using this exact format:

**Summary:** [1-2 sentences describing the key outcome]

**Details:** [A paragraph with more specifics about what was done, files changed, etc.]

Rules:
- Write in a scientific log style: factual, concise, and informative. Example: "Added user authentication endpoint with JWT validation" not "I helped you add authentication".
- Be specific about what was actually accomplished, not what was attempted.
- Focus only on meaningful work that was done. Omit filler phrases like "the task is complete", "no further action needed", "everything is working", etc.
- NEVER start with conversational words like "Excellent!", "Perfect!", "Great!", "Awesome!", "Done!", or any similar expressions. These add no information value.
- NEVER include preamble about session context, interaction history, or caveats like "This is our first interaction", "there's no prior work to summarize", "you asked me to", etc. Jump straight to the accomplishment.
- Start directly with the action taken using a verb (e.g., "Fixed button visibility..." not "You asked me to fix..." and not "Excellent! Fixed...").
- If nothing meaningful was accomplished (no code changes, no files modified, no research completed, just greetings or introductions), respond with ONLY the text: NOTHING_TO_REPORT
- Use NOTHING_TO_REPORT when the conversation was just a greeting, introduction, or there genuinely was no work to summarize.
