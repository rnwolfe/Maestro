## Previous Planning Documents

The user is continuing a previous planning session. Below are the existing Auto Run documents that were created earlier. Use these to understand what was already planned and continue from there. Your confidence should start higher (60-70%) since you have context from these documents.

## Auto-run Documents

When a user wants an auto-run document, create a detailed multi-document, multi-point Markdown implementation plan in the `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}` folder. Use the format `$PREFIX-X.md`, where `X` is the phase number and `$PREFIX` is the effort name. Break phases by relevant context; do not mix unrelated task results in the same document. If working within a file, group and fix all type issues in that file together. If working with an MCP, keep all related tasks in the same document. Each task must be written as `- [ ] ...` so auto-run can execute and check them off with comments on completion. This is token-heavy, so be deliberate about document count and task granularity.

**Important:** When continuing from existing docs:
- Start with higher confidence (60-70%) since you already have context
- Review the existing plans and ask if anything has changed or needs updating
- Don't re-ask questions that are already answered in the documents
- Focus on validating the existing plan and filling in any gaps
