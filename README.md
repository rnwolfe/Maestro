### Custom AI Commands

Create your own slash commands in **Settings > Custom AI Commands**. Each command has a trigger (e.g., `/deploy`) and a prompt that gets sent to the AI agent.

Commands support **template variables** that are automatically substituted at runtime:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{SESSION_NAME}}` | Current session name |
| `{{AGENT_SESSION_ID}}` | Agent session ID (for conversation continuity) |
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | Project folder name |
| `{{PROJECT_PATH}}` | Full path to project directory |
| `{{GIT_BRANCH}}` | Current git branch (if in a git repo) |
| `{{DATE}}` | Current date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `{{TIME}}` | Current time (HH:MM:SS) |
| `{{WEEKDAY}}` | Day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) |

**Example**: A custom `/standup` command with prompt:
```
It's {{WEEKDAY}}, {{DATE}}. I'm on branch {{GIT_BRANCH}} in {{PROJECT_NAME}}.
Summarize what I worked on yesterday and suggest priorities for today.
```

See the full list of available variables in the **Template Variables** section within the Custom AI Commands panel.

## Auto Run

Auto Run is a file-system-based document runner that lets you batch-process tasks using AI agents. Select a folder containing markdown documents with task checkboxes, and Maestro will work through them one by one, spawning a fresh AI session for each task.

### Setting Up Auto Run

1. Navigate to the **Auto Run** tab in the right panel (`Cmd+Shift+1`)
2. Select a folder containing your markdown task documents
3. Each `.md` file becomes a selectable document

### Creating Tasks

Use markdown checkboxes in your documents:

```markdown
# Feature Implementation Plan

- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add unit tests for the login flow
- [ ] Update API documentation
```

**Tip**: Press `Cmd+L` (Mac) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) to quickly insert a new checkbox at your cursor position.

### Running Single Documents

1. Select a document from the dropdown
2. Click the **Run** button (or the ▶ icon)
3. Customize the agent prompt if needed, then click **Go**

### Multi-Document Batch Runs

Auto Run supports running multiple documents in sequence:

1. Click **Run** to open the Batch Runner Modal
2. Click **+ Add Docs** to add more documents to the queue
3. Drag to reorder documents as needed
4. Configure options per document:
   - **Reset on Completion** - Uncheck all boxes when document completes (for repeatable tasks)
   - **Duplicate** - Add the same document multiple times
5. Enable **Loop Mode** to cycle back to the first document after completing the last
6. Click **Go** to start the batch run

### Playbooks

Save your batch configurations for reuse:

1. Configure your documents, order, and options
2. Click **Save as Playbook** and enter a name
3. Load saved playbooks from the **Load Playbook** dropdown
4. Update or discard changes to loaded playbooks

### Git Worktree Support

For parallel work without file conflicts:

1. Enable **Worktree** in the Batch Runner Modal
2. Specify a worktree path and branch name
3. Auto Run operates in the isolated worktree
4. Optionally create a PR when the batch completes

Without a worktree, Auto Run queues with other write operations to prevent conflicts.

### Progress Tracking

The runner will:
- Process tasks serially from top to bottom
- Skip documents with no unchecked tasks
- Show progress: "Document X of Y" and "Task X of Y"
- Mark tasks as complete (`- [x]`) when done
- Log each completion to the **History** panel

### History & Tracking

Each completed task is logged to the History panel with:
- **AUTO** label indicating automated execution
- **Session ID** pill (clickable to jump to that AI conversation)
- **Summary** of what the agent accomplished
- **Full response** viewable by clicking the entry

**Keyboard navigation in History**:
- `Up/Down Arrow` - Navigate entries
- `Enter` - View full response
- `Esc` - Close detail view and return to list

### Auto-Save

Documents auto-save after 5 seconds of inactivity, and immediately when switching documents. Full undo/redo support with `Cmd+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z`.

### Image Support

Paste images directly into your documents. Images are saved to an `images/` subfolder with relative paths for portability.

### Stopping the Runner

Click the **Stop** button at any time. The runner will:
- Complete the current task before stopping
- Preserve all completed work
- Allow you to resume later by clicking Run again

### Parallel Batches

You can run separate batch processes in different Maestro sessions simultaneously. Each session maintains its own independent batch state. With Git worktrees enabled, you can work on the main branch while Auto Run operates in an isolated worktree.

## Command Line Interface

Maestro includes a CLI tool (`maestro-playbook`) for running playbooks from the command line, cron jobs, or CI/CD pipelines. The CLI is a standalone binary that requires no additional dependencies.

### Installation

The CLI binary is bundled with Maestro. After installation, create a symlink to add it to your PATH:

```bash
# macOS (after installing Maestro.app)
sudo ln -sf "/Applications/Maestro.app/Contents/Resources/maestro-playbook" /usr/local/bin/maestro-playbook

# Windows (run as Administrator in PowerShell)
# The binary is located at: C:\Program Files\Maestro\resources\maestro-playbook.exe

# Linux (AppImage - extract first, or use deb/rpm which installs to /opt)
sudo ln -sf "/opt/Maestro/resources/maestro-playbook" /usr/local/bin/maestro-playbook
```

### Usage

```bash
# List all groups
maestro-playbook list groups

# List all agents
maestro-playbook list agents
maestro-playbook list agents --group <group-id>

# List playbooks for an agent
maestro-playbook list playbooks --agent <agent-id>

# Run a playbook
maestro-playbook run --agent <agent-id> --playbook <playbook-id>

# Dry run (shows what would be executed)
maestro-playbook run --agent <agent-id> --playbook <playbook-id> --dry-run

# Run without writing to history
maestro-playbook run --agent <agent-id> --playbook <playbook-id> --no-history
```

### JSON Output

By default, commands output human-readable formatted text. Use `--json` for machine-parseable JSONL output:

```bash
# Human-readable output (default)
maestro-playbook list groups
GROUPS (2)

  🎨  Frontend
      group-abc123
  ⚙️  Backend
      group-def456

# JSON output for scripting
maestro-playbook list groups --json
{"type":"group","id":"group-abc123","name":"Frontend","emoji":"🎨","timestamp":...}
{"type":"group","id":"group-def456","name":"Backend","emoji":"⚙️","timestamp":...}

# Running a playbook with JSON streams events
maestro-playbook run -a <agent-id> -p <playbook-id> --json
{"type":"start","timestamp":...,"playbook":{...}}
{"type":"document_start","timestamp":...,"document":"tasks.md","taskCount":5}
{"type":"task_start","timestamp":...,"taskIndex":0}
{"type":"task_complete","timestamp":...,"success":true,"summary":"...","elapsedMs":8000}
{"type":"document_complete","timestamp":...,"tasksCompleted":5}
{"type":"complete","timestamp":...,"totalTasksCompleted":5,"totalElapsedMs":60000}
```

### Scheduling with Cron

```bash
# Run a playbook every hour (use --json for log parsing)
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/maestro-playbook run -a <agent-id> -p <playbook-id> --json >> /var/log/maestro.jsonl 2>&1
```
